Based on interviews with 32 Lebanese public servants, the research explores how feelings of compassion and self-sacrifice related to public service motivation might encourage them to engage in corrupt behavior for what they see as a good cause. The study highlights that these motivations can lead to behaviors like providing extra support or shielding users from punishment. This can create internal conflicts within the public servant due to their emotional connection with those affected.",
  "10.3917/e.gmp.pr1.0018": "This study examines how public service motivation can lead to noble cause corruption in Lebanon, where there's a lot of social and economic hardship.

Factors like physical exchanges, personal space in the workplace, and close relationships with users can make it easier for this type of corruption to happen.",
  "10.56251/ojyp9121": "This paper discusses a scenario where autonomous killer robots are used in warfare without human intervention. These robots can make decisions about who to target based on AI algorithms trained to recognize certain uniforms. If one of these drones targets and kills an enemy soldier who is surrendering, it would violate international laws. Another concern is if the robot makes a mistake by attacking another similar system, leading to unintended conflicts.",

  "10.62264/ijccj.v2i2.248": "In Indonesia, there is usually one prosecutor for all cases, but for corruption specifically, a special body called KPK has its own authority to start investigations and trials. This dual system means that even though the Attorney General leads prosecutions in general, KPK can handle corruption cases independently without needing permission from them. This allows KPK to focus on fighting corruption more effectively while still following the overall rule of having only one prosecutor for most crimes.",
  "10.26623/jic.v11i1.13137": "This study looks at how Indonesia's prosecutor's office is trying to speed up important national projects while also fighting corruption. The current policies focus too much on punishing people who might be corrupt, which isn't fair or effective. To fix this, the researchers suggest making new rules that balance stopping bad behavior with helping prevent it from happening in the first place.
