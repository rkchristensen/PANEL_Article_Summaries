It suggests ways to improve the existing laws so that people in war zones can continue to rely on protections like not harming civilians unnecessarily."

They argue that by examining the historical context and biblical perspectives, we can find ways to apply these ideas in practical ways for modern ethical discussions."

This leads to internal conflicts as the person feels both guilty and supported by their work environment. Factors like physical exchanges, personal space in the workplace, and close relationships with users can make it easier for this type of corruption to happen."

The study highlights that these motivations can lead to behaviors like providing extra support or shielding users from punishment.
