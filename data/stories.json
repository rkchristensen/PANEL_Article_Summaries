It involves assessing risks explicitly within oversight to align with organizational goals and responsibilities. This approach extends beyond traditional compliance by integrating risk into decision-making processes, using tools like scenario analysis and dynamic portfolio management. The literature shows that institutions with strong risk-based governance are better at anticipating market changes, optimizing performance, and ensuring sustainable value creation while staying compliant."

The main idea is that current rules are still useful but need updating to fit with these new types of weapons. It suggests ways to improve the existing laws so that people in war zones can continue to rely on protections like not harming civilians unnecessarily."

The author suggests that understanding this ancient metaphor can help create a broader vision of what it means to be human and how we should act ethically today. They argue that by examining the historical context and biblical perspectives, we can find ways to apply these ideas in practical ways for modern ethical discussions."

Another concern is if the robot makes a mistake by attacking another similar system, leading to unintended conflicts."

This leads to internal conflicts as the person feels both guilty and supported by their work environment. Factors like physical exchanges, personal space in the workplace, and close relationships with users can make it easier for this type of corruption to happen."

Based on interviews with 32 Lebanese public servants, the research explores how feelings of compassion and self-sacrifice related to public service motivation might encourage them to engage in corrupt behavior for what they see as a good cause. The study highlights that these motivations can lead to behaviors like providing extra support or shielding users from punishment. This can create internal conflicts within the public servant due to their emotional connection with those affected."
